# Optimized-Agricultural-Production-and-Recommendation
Precision agriculture is in trend nowadays. It helps the farmers to get informed decision about the farming strategy. It is a predictive model to recommend the most suitable crops to grow in a particular farm based on various parameters.

In the crop recommendation, the user can provide the parameters like N-P-K, temperature, humidity, pH value, rainfall, crop from their side and the application will predict which crop should the user grow.

Nitrogen (N) – Nitrogen is largely responsible for the growth of leaves on the plant.
Phosphorus (P) – Phosphorus is largely responsible for root growth and flower and fruit development.
Potassium (K) – Potassium is a nutrient that helps the overall functions of the plant perform correctly.
